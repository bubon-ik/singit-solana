"""Venice AI chat client.

Venice does not price per request. Its x402 lane tops up a prepaid balance held
against a wallet address, and meters requests against that balance internally.
So exactly one step of this flow is an x402 payment:

    sign SIWE  ->  read balance  ->  [402 top-up: the only payment]
                                 ->  chat, chat, chat, ...

One $5 top-up buys on the order of a thousand messages. Everything after it is
an ordinary authenticated request carrying an EIP-4361 signature, and the true
cost of each message is read back from the `X-Balance-Remaining` header rather
than estimated.

The x402 settlement callable is injected, so tests never move funds.

Nothing here logs or persists prompt text or model output.
