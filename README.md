# SingIt Solana

A separate repository for adding Solana support to the SingIt Telegram agent.
Based on `SingItAI/main` at commit `f39959059922b693f14c2a3e9bec97c87881e07b`.

## Hackathon development record

See [HACKATHON.md](HACKATHON.md) for the existing SingIt foundation, recorded Solana work, verification evidence, and pending milestones. [Compare changes with the imported baseline](https://github.com/bubon-ik/singit-solana/compare/singit-base-baseline...main).

## Current status

- The full agent code has been imported from the committed `main` branch.
- The Venice/x402 client for Solana mainnet lives in `solana-x402-service/`.
- **The agent supports managed Solana wallets and Venice chat with exact-quote phone approval for x402 top-ups.** [Flow, recovery and verification](docs/venice-solana-agent.md).
- A real Bitrefill purchase was completed with USDC on Solana: [Alza CZ 200 CZK, live verification](docs/bitrefill-solana-checks.md). This was an operator-assisted run; agent purchasing integration remains pending.
- Native Telegram navigation, inline shopping controls and private purchase history are implemented: [UI checks and limitations](docs/telegram-ui-checks.md). The navigation update is deployed to the existing bot.
- No real Venice top-up or paid Venice model request has been completed.
- Public repository: [bubon-ik/singit-solana](https://github.com/bubon-ik/singit-solana).

## Solana wallet commands

- `/wallet` — choose Base or Solana.
- `/wallet solana` — ensure your managed Solana wallet exists and show its balance.
- `/deposit solana` — show its deposit address.
- `/balance solana` — read SOL and native-USDC balances.
- `/balance` — show Base balances by default; explicit network commands never change that default.

These commands are deployed to the running Telegram bot. Solana keys are encrypted
in the gateway store. Venice top-ups have a separate explicit approval flow;
Solana shop payments and withdrawals remain disabled. See
[wallet integration checks](docs/solana-wallet-checks.md).

## Checking the Solana module

Requires Node.js 24+. The rest of the project retains the baseline requirements below.

```sh
cd solana-x402-service
npm ci --ignore-scripts
npm test
npm run check
npm start -- --help
```

Quote and payment instructions: [Solana service](solana-x402-service/README.md).
Next steps and acceptance criteria: [integration plan](docs/solana-integration.md).

## Deployment

The existing VPS bot runs the approved `venice-solana` release. See
[deployment evidence and runtime setup](docs/venice-solana-agent.md). A real
Venice top-up and paid Solana answer remain the next live acceptance step.

Before starting a separate Telegram agent, configure its own bot token,
encryption key, wallet and operation databases, ports, and runtime directories.
The original gateway defaults to some paths in the user's home directory;
this repository does not yet override those paths automatically. Do not start
this copy with the running Base bot's configuration. Secrets and databases from
the original project have not been imported. The prototype Solana wallet is
stored separately from the gateway.

## Existing SingIt capabilities

**Payments for AI agents, with spending limits and human approval.**

SingIt connects a Telegram assistant to managed wallets on Base. It can buy
gift cards and mobile top-ups, pay for x402 APIs, and fund LLM credits. The
payment gateway handles wallet keys, spending controls, approvals and receipts.

[![Security gate](https://github.com/bubon-ik/singit-solana/actions/workflows/security-gate.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/bubon-ik/singit-solana/actions/workflows/security-gate.yml)

## Features

- **Managed Base wallets:** create a wallet, check balances, set spending limits
  and withdraw through Telegram.
- **Bitrefill purchases:** browse products, review a quote, buy gift cards or
  mobile top-ups, and retrieve the result.
- **x402 payments:** pay for supported APIs using USDC on Base.
- **Payment policy:** use Spending Memory to allow, escalate or block supported
  purchases according to budgets and merchant history.
- **Separate approval channels:** confirm purchases through iMessage or WhatsApp
  when human approval is required.
- **LLM credits:** top up through Bankr. Optional integrations add Venice chat
  and paid onchain data queries through The Graph.

These are capabilities in the repository. Availability in a deployment depends
on its configuration and installed version; `main` is not automatically the
version running on the server. See [operations](docs/operations.md) for the
recorded deployment state.

## How payments work

For supported x402-tool and Bitrefill purchases, the gateway checks the quote
and spending limits before execution. With Spending Memory enabled, the policy
returns one of three decisions:

| Decision | Outcome |
| --- | --- |
| `PAY` | Proceed within the configured policy and limits. |
| `ESCALATE` | Ask the owner to approve the purchase. |
| `BLOCK` | Refuse the payment. |

In strict mode, covered purchases require human approval. An approval is bound
to the purchase terms; the payment must match the approved amount, asset and
recipient. LLM credit purchases, Venice chat and web search have separate
flows and are not covered by one universal approval policy.

The optional [Ledger integration](docs/ledger-v1.md) supports purchase consent
for a configured owner's GET x402 tools. The device signs the approval; the
gateway wallet signs the payment. Ledger Key Ring support for the wallet
master key is a separate, opt-in feature.

## Using the Telegram bot

Open the [bot](https://t.me/SingIt0qk_bot) and send `/start`.
Wallet commands run through the gateway without calling an LLM.

| Command | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `/wallet [base\|solana]` | Choose a network, or show its wallet balance. |
| `/deposit [base\|solana]` | Show a deposit address; defaults to Base. |
| `/purchases` | Browse saved receipts and explicitly reveal a code. |
| `/settings` | Delivery email, approvals and spending limits. |
| `/balance [base\|solana]` | Check wallet balances; defaults to Base. |
| `/limits` | View or change spending limits. |
| `/bitrefill` | Browse products and start a purchase. |
| `/last_purchase` | Check the most recent purchase. |
| `/withdraw` | Send funds to your own address. |
| `/connect_imessage` | Pair an iMessage approval channel. |
| `/connect_whatsapp` | Pair a WhatsApp approval channel. |
| `/llm_buy` | Buy LLM credits through Bankr. |

## Development setup

Use **Python 3.12**, **Node.js 22** and **Git** to match CI. The gateway package
supports Python 3.11 or later. Clone the full repository: the gateway imports
shared code from sibling directories.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bubon-ik/singit-solana.git
cd singit-solana
python3.12 -m venv sign402-gateway/.venv
sign402-gateway/.venv/bin/python -m pip install -e ./sign402-gateway python-telegram-bot==22.5
```

Run the Python unit tests from the repository root:

```bash
(cd sign402-gateway && .venv/bin/python -m unittest discover -s tests)
(cd hermes-plugins/sign402-wallet && ../../sign402-gateway/.venv/bin/python -m unittest discover -s tests)
```

Run the Node unit tests:

```bash
(cd cdp-x402-service && npm ci --ignore-scripts && npm test)
(cd singit-risk-check && npm ci --ignore-scripts && npm test)
(cd tools/ledger-approve && npm ci --ignore-scripts && npm test)
```

The unit suites use test doubles for external services and hardware; no funded
wallet or Ledger device is needed. They cover payment limits, approval binding,
retries, authentication and provider integrations. CI also audits dependencies.

Running the connected service requires configuration beyond installing the
package: wallet encryption and API secrets, payment-provider credentials,
Hermes, and the chosen approval channel. Start with the
[environment reference](sign402-gateway/.env.example),
[Telegram plugin setup](hermes-plugins/sign402-wallet/README.md),
[CDP service setup](cdp-x402-service/README.md#setup) and
[operations runbook](docs/operations.md). For real Ledger use, follow the
[Ledger installation instructions](docs/ledger-v1.md).

## Repository structure

| Directory | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `sign402-gateway/` | Python gateway: wallets, payment policy, approvals, orders and APIs. |
| `hermes-plugins/sign402-wallet/` | Telegram wallet commands and purchase flows for Hermes. |
| `solana-x402-service/` | Solana mainnet Venice/x402 client and private gateway bridge with exact payment approval. |
| `cdp-x402-service/` | Node.js payment and swap integration for Base through CDP and x402. |
| `tools/ledger-approve/` | Local Ledger purchase-approval client. |
| `singit-risk-check/` | SINGIT-paid x402 endpoint for payment-requirement risk analysis. |
| `website/` | Public website. |
| `docs/` | Operating instructions, integration guides and verification records. |
| `sign402-bridge/`, `payment-executor/`, `live-demo/` | Legacy integrations and shared utilities still imported by the gateway. |

[Spending Memory](https://github.com/bubon-ik/spending-memory) is maintained in a
separate repository. It provides the reusable payment-policy library and Graph
query adapter; this gateway installs a pinned revision.

## Security and custody

Managed wallets are **custodial**. Private keys are encrypted at rest and used
by the gateway, rather than supplied to the agent. Encryption and approval
checks do not remove the need to trust the server and its approval adapters.

Keep credentials and runtime databases out of Git. Back up wallet and order
state before updating a deployment. Read the
[security model](sign402-gateway/SECURITY.md) for trust boundaries and controls,
and the [recovery runbook](docs/recovery-runbook.md) for backup and recovery.
