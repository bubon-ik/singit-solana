## Competition period and disclosure

The [official rules](https://colosseum.com/legal/Crypto%20World%27s%20Fair%20Hackathon%20Rules.pdf), section 5, specify September 14, 2026 at 6:00 AM PT through October 12, 2026 at 11:59 PM PT. The [Colosseum FAQ](https://colosseum.com/hackathon) permits existing code, requires disclosure of relevant previous development, and says products are judged on work completed during the competition period.

SingIt existed before this Solana effort. This repository preserves its Git history and builds on its existing agent, Base wallet, payment and approval infrastructure. Creating this repository does not make the imported code new hackathon work.

The imported baseline is `f39959059922b693f14c2a3e9bec97c87881e07b`, dated September 17, 2026. The tag `singit-base-baseline` marks the source version used for this integration. **It is not a snapshot from the competition's September 14 start.** The comparison above isolates changes in this Solana repository; it is not an exhaustive list of all work across other repositories during the competition. Imported upstream work is excluded from the Solana contribution described here.

## Existing foundation

The imported source already contains the Telegram/Hermes agent, managed Base wallets, gateway authentication, payment policies and approval channels, Bitrefill purchase flows, Base x402 tooling, and a Venice integration using Ethereum authentication. These are reused components, not new Solana capabilities. Their availability in a running deployment depends on configuration.

## Work recorded in this repository

| Date | Commit | Contribution | Evidence and limits |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2026-09-17 | [2f5c1b0](https://github.com/bubon-ik/singit-solana/commit/2f5c1b0) | Added the standalone Solana/Venice x402 client, tests, integration plan and CI workflow to the imported agent repository. | 34 local tests passed. Live Solana authentication and an unpaid Venice quote were checked. No real payment or paid model response was completed. The client was developed separately earlier in this work session and first committed here as a module; this is not a record of each individual implementation step. |
| 2026-09-17 | [57ef9c3](https://github.com/bubon-ik/singit-solana/commit/57ef9c3) | Documented the separate public repository. | Documentation only. |
| 2026-09-17 | [f0eaa0b](https://github.com/bubon-ik/singit-solana/commit/f0eaa0b) | Converted the root and Solana module README files to English. | Documentation only. |
| 2026-09-17 | [eb10f40](https://github.com/bubon-ik/singit-solana/commit/eb10f40) | Added per-user encrypted Solana wallets, mainnet SOL/native-USDC balances, explicit network routing, and `/wallet solana` / `/balance solana` in the Telegram plugin. Preserved Base wallets and blocked Solana requests from entering legacy Base spending routes. | 1,234 gateway tests and 284 plugin tests passed. A temporary empty wallet was accepted by the Solana SDK; live mainnet RPC returned zero SOL and USDC. No production deployment, real Telegram transport run or payment. |
| 2026-09-18 | [19ae280](https://github.com/bubon-ik/singit-solana/commit/19ae280) | Refreshed native Telegram navigation, added named inline shopping controls and order review, editable operation cards, a Base/Solana wallet selector, and private purchase history with selected-order code reveal. | 1,245 gateway tests and 302 plugin tests passed, including actual PTB handler/markup construction with mocked transport. Existing Base approvals and spending policy remain in place. No Mini App, live bot deployment or Solana payment integration. [Details](docs/telegram-ui-checks.md). |
| 2026-09-19 | [37f7863](https://github.com/bubon-ik/singit-solana/commit/37f7863) | Replaced persistent Telegram navigation with native Menu and inline controls; added free-text AI entry, model/budget review and approval before the saved first question, payment-aware settings, safe cancellation and catalog search shortcuts. | 1,246 gateway and 332 plugin tests passed locally and on the VPS. Deployed to the existing bot at `a2ac835`; native Telegram Menu verified via API. Payments and transport tests were mocked; agent spending remains on Base. [Details](docs/conversation-ui-checks.md). |
| 2026-09-20 | [858a11e](https://github.com/bubon-ik/singit-solana/commit/858a11e) | Added Settings beside Wallet on Home, explained phone linking before payment, and put WhatsApp/iMessage connection first in Settings. | 332 plugin tests passed locally and on the VPS. Deployed to the existing bot; 95 wallet records and purchase history preserved. Existing phone verification and payment controls are unchanged. |
| 2026-09-20 | [PR #3](https://github.com/bubon-ik/singit-solana/pull/3) · [715d919](https://github.com/bubon-ik/singit-solana/commit/715d919), [337e777](https://github.com/bubon-ik/singit-solana/commit/337e777) | Integrated Venice into managed Solana wallets, added an AI network selector, separate per-network models/budgets, exact-quote phone approval, persistent payment holds and read-only recovery. | 1,289 gateway, 343 Telegram and 39 Node tests passed locally and on the VPS; all seven CI checks passed. Deployed at `337e777`, preserving 95 Base and 1 Solana wallet. Live managed-wallet SIWX balance and an unpaid quote were verified; no live Venice payment or paid Solana answer has been completed. [Flow and limits](docs/venice-solana-agent.md). |

The Venice client implements Solana SIWX authentication, mainnet USDC quote validation, explicit quote approval, SDK transaction construction, durable payment attempts, duplicate prevention and read-only reconciliation. Its Venice payment flow has only been exercised with mocked network responses.

### September 18: first real Bitrefill purchase

An operator-assisted Alza CZ 200 CZK purchase completed through the project Bitrefill MCP client and the Solana SDK payment wrapper. The final charge was 9.44 USDC, the exact transaction was confirmed on mainnet, and the actual gift-card code was retrieved using the paying wallet. [Evidence and limits](docs/bitrefill-solana-checks.md) · [Record history](https://github.com/bubon-ik/singit-solana/commits/main/docs/bitrefill-solana-checks.md).

Temporary helpers coordinated this live check; it does not constitute a reusable Bitrefill Solana adapter or a deployed Telegram purchase flow. No redemption data, buyer email or payment credentials are published.

### September 18: existing Telegram bot updated

At the owner's explicit request, release
[`6b3c2f5`](https://github.com/bubon-ik/singit-solana/commit/6b3c2f5) replaced the
existing VPS bot after private backups. It retained the existing bot identity,
Base wallets, configuration and purchase history. Before switching, 1,245
gateway tests, 302 plugin tests with the server's installed Telegram library,
and 46 CDP helper tests passed. Both services started, gateway health and
Telegram authentication succeeded, and unauthenticated purchase-history access
was rejected. Manual Telegram navigation and a purchase through the refreshed
UI remain unverified. This deployment does not enable Solana spending through
the bot. [Deployment checks](docs/telegram-ui-checks.md#existing-vps-bot-replacement).

### September 19: conversation and native Menu deployed

Release [`a2ac835`](https://github.com/bubon-ik/singit-solana/commit/a2ac835)
updated the existing VPS bot after private backups and server-runtime checks.
All 95 wallet records, configuration and purchase history were verified intact.
Both services are healthy; Telegram API confirms the six-command native Menu.
No live inference or purchase was performed for verification.
[Deployment details](docs/conversation-ui-checks.md#existing-vps-bot-updated).

## Pending work — not claimed as completed

- Manually verify the deployed wallet commands and refreshed navigation in Telegram.
- A real mainnet Venice payment and paid response through the agent.
- Integration of the verified Bitrefill Solana route into the per-user agent, approvals and durable recovery.
- A custom x402 stock-purchase endpoint.

## Evidence to maintain during development

For each completed feature, add the date, commit or pull-request link, user-visible behavior, verification results and remaining limitations. Keep feature commits focused and push completed milestones regularly. Preserve published history and the baseline tag. Do not change timestamps or describe planned behavior as implemented.

Record mainnet transaction links only after actual execution and add short demo recordings for completed agent flows. Do not publish private keys, auth tokens, payment payloads or redemption data. At submission, link a fixed final commit or release and its comparison with the baseline, and copy the prior-work disclosure into the submission form. Git history, public progress updates, tests and demos provide complementary evidence; commit dates alone do not establish when every line was developed.
