# SingIt Wallet Hermes Plugin

This Hermes plugin exposes deterministic managed-wallet commands in
Telegram:

```text
/start
/wallet [base|solana]
/balance [base|solana]
/deposit [base|solana]
/purchases
/settings
/connect_imessage
/connect_whatsapp
/limits
/withdraw
/bitrefill
/last_purchase
/llm_buy
```

The commands do not call the configured LLM. The plugin binds each request
to `MessageEvent.source.user_id`, lets Hermes apply its normal Telegram
authorization, and then calls the protected Sign402 Gateway on localhost.
Raw command arguments cannot select another Telegram user.

## Native Telegram interface

Home offers Shop, Wallet, Purchases and Settings, plus Chat when enabled.
Contextual inline buttons name products, amounts and payment tokens. A review
step precedes the existing approval/purchase flow. History shows receipts and
keeps redemption codes hidden until requested; code messages remain in chat.
The main menu uses a persistent Telegram keyboard. No Mini App is required.

[Interface behavior, storage migration and verification](../../docs/telegram-ui-checks.md).

## Solana wallets

`/wallet` opens the Base/Solana network selector. `/wallet solana` ensures a
managed Solana mainnet wallet exists and shows its balance; `/deposit solana`
shows the address. `/balance solana` shows SOL and native USDC. `/balance` and
`/deposit` default to Base. Selecting Solana does not change later commands' network.

Keys are encrypted with `SIGN402_WALLET_MASTER_KEY` in the gateway's wallet
store. Configure `SIGN402_SOLANA_RPC_URL` on the gateway for mainnet balance
reads. This stage supports wallet creation and balances only: Solana payments,
withdrawals, spending policies and Venice chat routing are not enabled yet.
The USDC balance includes all owned native-USDC accounts; the future payment
adapter must separately check its source associated token account.

## Server Configuration

The Hermes gateway process needs these values in `~/.hermes/.env`:

```env
SIGN402_GATEWAY_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8099
SIGN402_WALLET_API_TOKEN=<same value configured for sign402-gateway>
SIGN402_PHOTON_API_TOKEN=<same value configured for sign402-gateway>
SIGN402_TELEGRAM_SIGN402_ONLY=1
SIGN402_TELEGRAM_ALLOWED_USERS=*
HERMES_TELEGRAM_TEXT_BATCH_DELAY_SECONDS=0.08
TELEGRAM_ALLOWED_USERS=<operator Telegram ID>
SIGN402_IMESSAGE_PUBLIC_LINE=<public Sign402 iMessage number or contact>
SIGN402_WHATSAPP_PUBLIC_LINE=<public Meta WhatsApp Business number or wa.me link>
SIGN402_PHOTON_AUTO_REGISTER_USERS=1
PHOTON_PROJECT_ID=<Photon project id>
PHOTON_PROJECT_SECRET=<Photon project secret>

# Added by `hermes whatsapp-cloud` for inbound Meta webhooks:
WHATSAPP_CLOUD_PHONE_NUMBER_ID=<Meta Phone Number ID>
WHATSAPP_CLOUD_ACCESS_TOKEN=<Meta System User token>
WHATSAPP_CLOUD_APP_SECRET=<Meta App Secret>
WHATSAPP_CLOUD_VERIFY_TOKEN=<random webhook verify token>
WHATSAPP_CLOUD_ALLOWED_USERS=<test wa_id without +>
```

The Sign402 Gateway systemd environment also needs:

```env
SIGN402_PHOTON_API_TOKEN=<independent random bearer token>
SIGN402_IMESSAGE_APPROVAL_STORE_PATH=/home/hermes/.sign402/imessage-approvals.db
SIGN402_HERMES_CLI=/home/hermes/.local/bin/hermes
SIGN402_HERMES_HOME=/home/hermes/.hermes
SIGN402_WHATSAPP_ACCESS_TOKEN=<same Meta System User token>
SIGN402_WHATSAPP_PHONE_NUMBER_ID=<Meta Phone Number ID>
SIGN402_WHATSAPP_TEMPLATE_NAME=singit_payment_request
SIGN402_WHATSAPP_TEMPLATE_LANGUAGE=en
SIGN402_WHATSAPP_GRAPH_API_VERSION=v25.0
```

Do not put wallet, Photon, or Meta API tokens in `SOUL.md`, a skill, a prompt,
Telegram, iMessage, WhatsApp, or repository files. Keep `~/.hermes/.env` readable only
by the `hermes` user:

```bash
chmod 600 ~/.hermes/.env
```

The plugin rejects non-loopback gateway URLs so a configuration mistake
cannot send the bearer token to a remote host.

`SIGN402_TELEGRAM_SIGN402_ONLY=1` is required for public beta. It catches
ordinary Telegram text that is not a Sign402 command or wizard response and
returns the Sign402 menu instead of letting the message fall through to the
general Hermes LLM chat.

Optional [natural-language routing](../../docs/natural-language-assistant.md)
uses TypeSafe to send ordinary requests to existing shopping and read-only
wallet workflows before this menu fallback. It is disabled by default and
does not require a user's Venice setup. Direct delivery/booking requests offer
gift cards only as an explicitly accepted alternative; they do not claim to
place the underlying order.

`SIGN402_TELEGRAM_ALLOWED_USERS=*` opens only the Sign402 plugin to every
Telegram user. Keep `TELEGRAM_ALLOWED_USERS` restricted to the operator and do
not set `TELEGRAM_ALLOW_ALL_USERS` or `GATEWAY_ALLOW_ALL_USERS`; the plugin
intercepts public Sign402 traffic before Hermes can dispatch it to the general
agent. An unset `SIGN402_TELEGRAM_ALLOWED_USERS` falls back to the private
`TELEGRAM_ALLOWED_USERS` setting. If neither policy is set, Telegram wallet
traffic is denied by default. A wildcard Sign402 policy also forces
Sign402-only handling as a defensive fallback if the mode flag is omitted.

`HERMES_TELEGRAM_TEXT_BATCH_DELAY_SECONDS=0.08` uses Hermes's supported minimum
quiet period for short Telegram messages and buttons. Sign402 replies are
scheduled through Hermes's active asynchronous Telegram client, so Telegram
network stalls never block gateway button dispatch. Long messages near
Telegram's 4096-character split boundary keep their separate aggregation delay.

`SIGN402_IMESSAGE_PUBLIC_LINE` is shown in the `/connect_imessage` response
when automatic Photon registration is disabled. It identifies the shared line
where users should send their pairing code.

`SIGN402_PHOTON_AUTO_REGISTER_USERS=1` makes `/connect_imessage` ask the
Telegram user for their iMessage phone number, add that number to Photon
Project Users through Spectrum API, then return the pairing code. Users do not
need a Photon account, but on the shared Photon number pool they must send the
pairing code from their phone-number iMessage handle, not an Apple ID email.
For this mode, Telegram shows the assigned private Photon line only after the
phone number has been registered; do not tell users to use a stale shared line.
Automatic provisioning is capped at three valid phone-number attempts per
Telegram user per hour, with a beta-wide hourly guard, to protect the shared
Photon number pool from abuse.

`/connect_imessage` and `/connect_whatsapp` first select the requested channel
immediately when that Telegram wallet already has a corresponding link. They
start pairing only when the requested channel has not been linked yet, so
switching between existing iMessage and WhatsApp links never asks for another
phone number or code and never removes the other link.

For a first-time WhatsApp connection, `/connect_whatsapp` creates the same
single-use pairing code without using Photon. The user sends it to
`SIGN402_WHATSAPP_PUBLIC_LINE`; Hermes receives the signed Meta webhook through
its official `whatsapp_cloud` adapter, and the plugin links the trusted Meta
`wa_id`. Pairing WhatsApp makes it the user's sole active approval channel.

Run the Hermes Cloud setup wizard before enabling WhatsApp:

```bash
hermes whatsapp-cloud
```

The production Cloudflare Tunnel publishes the Hermes webhook at
`https://whatsapp.singitai.app/whatsapp/webhook`. Configure that exact callback
in Meta and subscribe the WhatsApp app to the `messages` field. A temporary
`trycloudflare.com` URL is suitable only for a short operator test because it
changes whenever the quick tunnel restarts.

Create and obtain Meta approval for a `UTILITY` template named
`singit_payment_request`, language `en`, with three body variables and two
quick-reply buttons in this order:

```text
SingIt payment approval
{{1}}
Approval reference: {{2}}
Expires: {{3}}

[Approve] [Reject]
```

The gateway always sends this template for WhatsApp payment approvals, so the
request works even outside Meta's 24-hour customer-service window. Hermes
currently handles the signed inbound webhook; the gateway calls Meta directly
only for this approved outbound template.

## Bitrefill payment token selection

Every Telegram user pays from the managed Base wallet already shown by
`/wallet` and `/balance`. The interactive Bitrefill flow asks for a payment
token after the product amount and recipient fields. Its numbered buttons reuse
the same positive-balance inventory as `/withdraw`; no second wallet or balance
store is created.

The token choice is mandatory. The gateway resolves the selected address again
for the authenticated Telegram user, prices that asset to USDC, and commits its
address and maximum atomic amount into the WhatsApp/iMessage approval. A changed
balance, token identity, quote, or unavailable swap stops the purchase before
Bitrefill fulfillment.

For direct commands, include the wallet token symbol or contract address:

```text
/bitrefill <productId> <packageId> <country> <token>
```

Example: `/bitrefill bitrefill-giftcard-usd 1 US USDC`. If duplicate unverified
tokens share a symbol, use the contract address instead.

## Bitrefill catalog responsiveness

Opening `Browse Catalog` sends the category keyboard first and then silently
warms the selected country's catalog in a background worker. Selecting `All`,
another category, or a later page reuses the gateway's country snapshot, so
Telegram button processing never waits for the warm-up itself. A warm-up error
does not change the user's wizard session or send an extra failure message.

This optimization applies only to browsing. Selecting a product still loads
its current details and packages, and every price check and purchase remains a
live Bitrefill MCP request.

## Install

From the server checkout as the `hermes` user:

```bash
cd ~/apps/sign402
./scripts/install-hermes-wallet-plugin.sh
hermes plugins list
hermes gateway restart
hermes gateway status
```

The installer creates:

```text
~/.hermes/plugins/sign402-wallet -> ~/apps/sign402/hermes-plugins/sign402-wallet
```

It refuses to overwrite an unrelated existing plugin path and never reads
or writes secrets.

## First Test

Set either `SIGN402_TELEGRAM_ALLOWED_USERS` or the existing Telegram allowlist
to the operator account before testing.
In Telegram, run:

```text
/wallet
/balance
/connect_imessage
/connect_whatsapp
```

Expected behavior:

- `/wallet` creates a Base wallet when needed, then returns its address.
- `/balance` returns balances or the safe balance-unavailable response.
- `/connect_imessage` returns a short pairing code.
- `/connect_whatsapp` returns a short pairing code for the Meta business number.

Send the pairing code to the chosen channel. A real, low-value purchase is the
user-facing approval check: iMessage accepts `YES`/`NO`; WhatsApp displays
Approve/Reject buttons bound to the exact approval ID. Both channels are
approval-only: unrelated messages are dropped before the general Hermes chat.
Use Telegram for wallet and agent interactions.

The Sign402 Gateway remains private on `127.0.0.1:8099`. WhatsApp additionally
requires a public HTTPS tunnel only for Hermes's signed Meta webhook endpoint.

## Public Beta

Before opening the bot, set both `SIGN402_TELEGRAM_SIGN402_ONLY=1` and an
explicit `SIGN402_TELEGRAM_ALLOWED_USERS` policy in `~/.hermes/.env`. Then
follow `docs/production-beta-checklist.md` from the repository root.

## Diagnostics

Check plugin and gateway status:

```bash
hermes plugins list
hermes gateway status
journalctl --user -u hermes-gateway -n 100 --no-pager
```

The plugin returns fixed user-safe errors. It does not log bearer tokens,
private keys, request payloads, or upstream response bodies.
