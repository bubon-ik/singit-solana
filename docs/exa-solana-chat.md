# Exa search in Solana AI chat

Exa supplies web results to the selected Venice model. Search uses the user's
managed Solana wallet and a separate, opt-in budget. It does not consume prepaid
Venice credit. Base chat retains its existing search implementation.

## User flow

1. Open **Chat → AI settings → Solana**. Create a Solana wallet if needed, choose
   a model and approve the Venice budget. Each Venice top-up still needs approval
   of its exact quote. Search requires usable Venice credit before it can spend.
2. Open **Web search → Review search budget**. The review identifies the wallet,
   Exa recipient, network, native USDC mint, endpoint, current price and limits.
3. Choose **Request search approval** and confirm through the linked phone
   channel. Connect a phone in Settings first if it is not paired.
4. Ask a normal question. The selected Venice model answers directly when it
   has enough information, or requests an Exa search when it needs external
   evidence. No search button or keyword is required for each question. The bot
   can buy one search and then pass its excerpts back to the same model.
5. The answer shows numbered source links, the separate Exa charge, a Solana
   transaction link, and the remaining Venice credit.

The standing approval permits **at most 0.02 USDC per search, 0.20 USDC and 20
searches per UTC day, for 30 days**. There is no further phone prompt for each
search within that allowance. Approval itself moves no money. Revocation is
available under **Web search → Turn search off**. Reapproving does not reset
spending already recorded that day.

## Automatic search decisions

The selected Venice model makes the decision as part of its first completion.
It can answer directly or return a complete `NEED_WEB: <query>` control reply.
There is no separate classifier model and no keyword filter that forces search.
A translation containing “today” or “news” can therefore receive a direct answer;
an implicit request for a registration deadline can request external evidence.

Only a complete, single-line query of at most 2,000 characters is accepted.
Quoted examples inside prose or code do not trigger payment. The original
question (up to 12,000 characters) is preserved for the final answer; the model
may condense it into a shorter search query. Sources never authorize spending.

The gateway checks the standing Exa approval, wallet, merchant, limits, payment
pause and pending journal before spending. The model cannot bypass them. If
approval is missing, the bot offers budget setup and asks the user to resend the
question. Turning search off still prevents Exa charges.

A searched answer uses **up to two Venice completions plus one Exa request**.
Both completions consume prepaid Venice credit at the selected model's rates.
The decision can use credit even when search is subsequently refused; the bot
reports that distinction and records the balance from the first completion.
It checks policy/pause again before the final completion. A second request for
search is refused without another purchase, and the paid sources/receipt remain
visible. A failed completion is never automatically retried.

Search returns three results with up to 1,200 characters of text each. No query,
model reply or source excerpt is added to the new payment journals. The providers
necessarily receive their request content. Selection quality depends on the
chosen model; offline fixtures verify routing and spending safeguards, not the
accuracy of every real model's decision. This flow uses the current message and
does not add cross-message conversation memory.

## Payment and recovery

- Fixed endpoint: `POST https://api.exa.ai/search`, `type: auto`, three results,
  `contents.text.maxCharacters: 1200`. No Exa API key is attached.
- Read the fresh `PAYMENT-REQUIRED` x402 v2 challenge. Only Solana mainnet/native
  USDC, an approved merchant and a sponsored network fee are accepted.
- Reserve cost and one call atomically in SQLite, rechecking the policy, amount,
  ownership, expiry and daily limits. Reservations cannot cross UTC midnight.
- Sign with the authenticated user's decrypted managed key over private stdin.
  Before the only submission, persist the signed message's hash. Never persist
  a secret key, signed payload, authentication header, query or source excerpt.
- Submit `PAYMENT-SIGNATURE` once. Verify the `PAYMENT-RESPONSE` transaction
  through Solana RPC against that exact signed message. Provider success alone
  is not proof of a confirmed payment.
- An unresolved payment blocks new searches, including after restart or midnight.
  **Search payment status** checks the journal and chain without sending money.
  For a missing receipt, `/chat_search_payment QUOTE_ID TRANSACTION_SIGNATURE`
  can reconcile an externally obtained signature; unrelated transactions fail.
- If the payment response or search results are lost, results cannot be recovered
  from this journal. A confirmed charge remains recorded. There is no automatic
  repurchase. If Venice fails after a successful search, show the search's sources
  and receipt. Empty results do not trigger a paid Venice completion.
- After a process restart, a Python reservation without a Node attempt remains
  held: an earlier child may still be running. An operator must establish that
  it exited without submission before releasing that hold.

Source excerpts are untrusted model input. They cannot change a payment policy,
select a merchant or trigger another payment. They are sent with a fixed system
instruction to ignore embedded commands and cite only supplied sources. This
instruction is not a guarantee of model answer accuracy.

## Operations

`SIGN402_AI_SEARCH_ENABLED=1` and `SIGN402_SOLANA_SEARCH_ENABLED` (defaults to `1`)
control availability. Individual users still start with search **off**. Turning
search availability off preserves status, revocation and payment recovery routes.
The global payment pause also blocks budget activation and paid searches.

Budget/proposal/receipt tables are in the existing private
`SIGN402_SOLANA_CHAT_STATE_DIR/chat.sqlite3`. Node submission journals use
`operations/<hashed-user-and-wallet>/exa/operations.sqlite3`, separate from
Venice top-ups. Back up the whole state directory, both managed-wallet tables
and configuration before deployment. Check `exa_payments` for `paying` or
`uncertain` rows before restarting a production gateway.

Authenticated gateway routes: `/agent/chat/search`, `search-prepare`,
`search-approve`, `search-disable`, and `search-payment` under the same prefix.
Explicit `chain: solana` is required by the plugin; a stale network selection
is rejected, never silently executed on Base.

## Verification — September 22, 2026

An **unpaid** probe from the VPS with the exact search body above returned HTTP
402, Solana mainnet/native USDC, `amount: 7000` (0.007 USDC), a 60-second payment
lifetime and a sponsored fee payer. This verifies offered terms, not settlement.

Offline tests cover standing consent, linked-phone hash binding, wallet
isolation, concurrent reservations, money/count limits, expiry, revocation,
restart/midnight recovery, separate receipts and source handling. The Node flow
uses the real x402 SVM builder and real Ed25519 signatures with local RPC and
provider fixtures. It verifies the signed transaction and passes results to the
selected Venice model fixture. Tests use generated unfunded wallets only.

Local verification passed: 1,309 gateway tests, 422 Telegram plugin tests and
49 Solana Node tests, plus syntax and whitespace checks.

Semantic-update local checks passed: 1,319 gateway tests, 423 plugin tests and
52 Solana Node tests. Semantic-decision regression coverage additionally checks implicit questions,
keyword-containing translations, strict control parsing, missing consent, pause
and expiry between stages, preserving the original question/model, and refusing
a second search. Telegram waits longer for Solana message responses to retain
receipts through the decision/search/answer sequence; Base timeouts are unchanged.

A real funded Exa search and a paid Venice response remain live acceptance steps
for the user after reviewing and approving their budgets. No mainnet Exa payment
was sent during implementation.

## Existing VPS deployment

**Current release:** [`5be0d7a`](https://github.com/bubon-ik/singit-solana/commit/5be0d7ab25e23d4be3454d57fde31513c680bd67), deployed September 22 on
`release/exa-auto-search-20260922`. This adds the model-selected search flow above.
The VPS runtimes passed all 1,319 gateway, 423 plugin and 52 Solana tests before
rollout, and all GitHub checks passed for the runtime commit. A private backup,
quiet-state checks and post-restart verification preserved all 95 Base wallets,
the Solana wallet, configuration and purchase history. Both services are active;
unauthenticated search routes return HTTP 401. No paid completion or search was
made by the deployment checks. Authenticated settings confirmed model-selected
search, the fresh Exa budget review, search remaining off before consent, a
signed Venice balance and the native Telegram menu. The original AI network was
restored, and startup logs contained no tracebacks.

### Earlier Exa rollout


Release [`12d8dc0`](https://github.com/bubon-ik/singit-solana/commit/12d8dc004235352262bb5c22fbbb124e8ad72e9b) was deployed to the existing **@SingIt0qk_bot** on
September 22, 2026, on branch `release/exa-solana-20260922`. The release contains
the deployed TypeSafe/conversation fixes; it does not replace them with the older
GitHub default branch. Later documentation commits do not imply a new runtime.

All 1,309 gateway, 422 plugin and 49 Solana tests passed in the VPS interpreters
before deployment, and all seven GitHub checks passed for the runtime commit.
A private backup preceded each restart. Post-restart checks verified preservation
of all 95 Base wallets, the Solana wallet, gateway/bot configuration and purchase
history. Both services are active, health is HTTP 200 and unauthenticated search
routes return HTTP 401.

During rollout, authenticated checks verified the real Exa budget review without
approval, search remaining off, unchanged search allowance, signed Venice balance,
model catalog, original AI network restored, native Telegram menu and no startup
tracebacks. No phone approval or mainnet payment was sent. Telegram button delivery
and the funded search/answer flow still require the user's live check.
