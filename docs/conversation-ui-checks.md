# Conversation and Telegram Menu — September 19, 2026

Implementation: [`37f7863`](https://github.com/bubon-ik/singit-solana/commit/37f7863).
This builds on the native Telegram interface milestone. It adds no Mini App and
changes no chain settlement implementation.

## Behavior

- The native Telegram **Menu** contains Shop, Chat, Wallet, Purchases, Settings
  and Help. Chat is hidden when its existing feature flag is disabled. Existing
  slash commands and old button labels remain accepted.
- Home and AI controls appear under messages. The first private reply after a
  restart removes the old persistent keyboard, then attaches inline controls
  to the same message. Older Hermes adapters use a one-time text keyboard.
- Ordinary private text checks the user's gateway policy and enters AI without
  a Chat/Stop chat mode. Explicit commands and active phone, withdrawal and
  shopping forms take priority. Unknown slash commands never become AI prompts.
- With no active policy, the original question is held in bounded process
  memory for up to 15 minutes of setup validity: confirm/select a model,
  choose a daily top-up limit, review terms, then request approval on the linked
  phone channel. Only an explicit successful approval sends the saved question.
- Model selection is free. AI settings display catalog input/output token
  prices, last recorded Venice credit, remaining daily top-up allowance and
  approval expiry. The daily allowance caps new funding, not consumption of
  previously paid Venice credit. The old misleading usage warning was removed.
- The current presets are $5/$10/$20 per day for 30 days. They are application
  choices. Budget approval itself is not a payment; a subsequent question may
  trigger a Base USDC x402 top-up under the existing payment policy.
- `/cancel` or navigation discards the deferred question. An external approval
  or payment already submitted can still finish. Existing standing approvals
  and paid provider credit are not revoked or refunded by navigation.
- AI work runs off the incoming-message hook. Per-user guards prevent a second
  chat payment while the first request is running, including after navigation.
  A paid answer arriving after navigation is still delivered. Reconciliation
  pauses cannot be cleared through the new budget screen.
- Short explicit phrases such as `Buy Alza 200 CZK` or `Купить Alza 200 CZK`
  start catalog search only. Product, country, available denomination, payment
  token and order review remain part of the existing purchase flow. This is a
  small deterministic shortcut, not a general natural-language shopping agent.

## Verification

- 1,246 gateway tests passed locally.
- 332 plugin tests passed locally with PTB 22.5, including actual PTB application,
  callback and markup objects with mocked transport.
- New checks cover consent before the saved question, negative/missing approval,
  cancellation before and during external approval, expiry, user/chat isolation,
  bounded drafts, duplicate input, status/scheduling failure, navigation during
  inference, preserved late answers, form precedence, private-only AI, expired
  policy, reconciliation pause, free model selection and catalog-only shortcuts.
- Transport checks cover keyboard removal, same-message inline attachment,
  attachment failure recovery, subsequent inline Home and deleted-card fallback.
- All payment/provider responses and Telegram transport in tests are fixtures.
  No real inference, top-up, gift-card purchase or redemption is part of testing.

## Manual check on the existing bot

1. Send `/start`: the large bottom keyboard disappears; Home buttons sit below
   the message and native **Menu** lists the main sections.
2. Send a question. A user with an existing active budget receives a paid answer;
   a new user first sees model setup. To test without spending, stop before
   **Request budget approval**. An approved user's ordinary question can spend.
3. Open `/chat`: compare Venice credit, top-up allowance, model prices and expiry.
4. During setup open `/wallet` or send `/cancel`: the saved question is discarded.
5. Send `Buy Alza 200 CZK`: inspect catalog results and available denominations.
   Stop at order review to avoid a purchase.
6. Open Purchases and Settings through Menu while chatting; both remain reachable.

## Limits

The deployed agent's chat and shop payment execution still uses Base. Solana
wallet/deposit/balance support and the standalone Solana client are separate
milestones; this interface does not claim integrated Solana purchases. The
existing Venice inference request remains per-question; this change does not
add multi-turn model memory. Drafts are neither durable nor replayed after a
restart. A restart invalidates old inline controls; `/start` restores navigation.


## Existing VPS bot updated

On September 19 the existing `@SingIt0qk_bot` was updated in place to
[`a2ac835`](https://github.com/bubon-ik/singit-solana/commit/a2ac835).
Before switching, 1,246 gateway tests and 332 plugin tests passed using the
server's installed interpreters and PTB 22.6. No dependency files changed.

A private backup was created before switching. All 95 encrypted wallet records,
bot configuration and purchase history were verified unchanged. Gateway and bot
services are active; health returned HTTP 200. Unauthenticated chat-status and
purchase-history requests returned HTTP 401. Telegram `getMe` confirmed the
existing bot, and `getMyCommands` / `getChatMenuButton` confirmed the six-command
native Menu. AI chat remains enabled. No startup tracebacks or automatic bot
restarts were observed. No live message, inference or purchase was sent during
verification; the manual navigation steps above remain a user check.


## September 20: make phone setup discoverable

Home now includes **Settings** beside Wallet. Its **Before your first payment**
section explains that users link their phone number through WhatsApp or iMessage
in Settings to receive payment approval requests. Settings puts the two connection
buttons first and explains where approvals arrive. The AI budget offer repeats
this setup step. Existing phone verification and payment controls are unchanged.
All 332 plugin tests passed locally after updating the existing layout and copy
expectations. UI and documentation remain in English.


Release [`858a11e`](https://github.com/bubon-ik/singit-solana/commit/858a11e)
was deployed to the existing bot on September 20 after the same 332 tests passed
with the server's installed dependencies. The Telegram service restarted; the
unchanged gateway stayed running. A private backup was created, and all 95 wallet
records, bot configuration and purchase history were verified unchanged. Both
services are active and unauthenticated chat/history requests return HTTP 401.
Send `/start` to receive the updated Home message; existing Telegram messages
are not rewritten automatically.
